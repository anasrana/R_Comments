Sassy Comments for Sublime Text 
=============================================

This package is forked from https://github.com/chrisborrowdale/Idiomatic-CSS-Comments-Snippets. The reason it was created is because 
I simply did not like the amount of space left under each block that was created.

## Install

You can install via the Sublime Text Package Control (http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and search for Sassy Comments.

## Usage

There are several shortcuts for the different comment blocks.

### Section Comment

Enter the shortcut `////` followed by the `tab` key

``` sass
// ==========================================================================
// This is a section comment block
// ==========================================================================
```

### Sub-Section Comment

Enter the shortcut `////.` followed by the `tab` key

``` sass
//
// This is a sub-section comment block
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Todo List Comment
Enter the shortcut `sctodo` followed by the `tab` key

``` sass
//
// TODO
//
// => This is a TODO comment block
```

### Long Comment

Enter the shortcut `///` followed by the `tab` key

``` sass
//
// This is a longer comment block
//
```

### Basic Comment
Since, by default, it only takes 2 keystrokes to form a basic comment, it was not necessary to have a snippet for this.
